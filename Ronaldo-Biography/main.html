      Sporting Club And Manchester United Career In A Nutshell
    </h1>
    <h2 id="scp" style="font-size: 30px">Sporting Club Career</h2>
    <p class="first">
      At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team
      manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[29] He
      subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16,
      under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a
      single season.[21] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his
      debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two
      goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[30] Over the course of the
      2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool
      manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[31] Manager
      Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at
      Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[32]
      Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo
      on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the
      inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially,
      United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a
      year.[33] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson
      to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24
      million[33] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young
      players" he had ever seen.[34] A decade after his departure from the club,
      in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their
      100,000th member.[35]

    <p class="second">
      Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too
      late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against
      Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him
      the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[37] His transfer fee
      made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football
      history.[38] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting,
      he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by
      such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[39]
      Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[40]
      A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be
      Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the
      most important and influential factors in my career."[41]
